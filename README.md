## Tools & Services

* Tools:
  * [Xcode 14.3](https://developer.apple.com/download/) with latest iOS SDK

## Project Setup

### Instalation

1. Clone repository:

  ```bash
  # over https:
  git clone https://github.com/PatrykKaczmarek/Floofs.git
  # or over SSH:
  git clone git@github.com:PatrykKaczmarek/Floofs.git
  ```

2. Go to `{SRCROOT}/Floofs/App/` and duplicate `AppConfig.sample.plist`. Change its name to `AppConfig.plist`. Open it and use appropriate config values. Alternatively paste `AppConfig.plist` receivedby the author.

	> ⚠️ `AppConfig.plist` is added to `.gitignore` so you won't accidentally push it to the repository.

	> ℹ️ You can obtain your own `CatsAPIKey` by signing up on the [main site](https://thecatapi.com/) and getting one emailed to you for free.


3. Open `Floofs.xcodeproj` file and build the project.

## Coding guidelines

- Respect Swift [API Design Guidelines](https://swift.org/documentation/api-design-guidelines/)
- The code must be readable and self-explanatory - full variable names, meaningful methods, etc.
- Don't leave any commented-out code.


## Technicalities

- **Separation of Concerns:** API part has been divided into 3 parts: generic `APILayer` that is being used by `DogsAPI` and `CatsAPI` packages. It strongly separates API services' logic and, at the same time, removes a lot of repetitions. Additionally, it allows using `open` and `public` access control modifiers to distinguish interface visibility even more.
- **Extendability:** using a generic-first approach, `Cat` and `Dog` models conform to `Pet` protocol, so the app can display type-erased models leveraging the same UI components. So maybe the user will see more floofs in the future? Who knows...
- **Repetitions Reduction:** leveraging caching mechanism, the app can remember and restore data without the neccessity of retrieving them from the API again:
	- **Model Caching** - `Cat` and `Dog` models are unique across the app. It means, when they change, old models are replaced by new models so the newly fetched data is stored for later usage.
	- **Image Caching** - `Kingfisher` framework takes care of memory and disk caches to reduce network usage.
- **Data Transfer Reduction:** - the app uses pagination to obtain cats' images in chunks, to fetch only data that will be visible to the user. Unfortunately `DogsAPI` does not support pagination.
- **Reliably Performant and Responsive:** multithreading allows to keep the app responsive and performant even when scrolling fast through the images gallery.
- **Launch Prerequisites Validation:** the app during launch time, checks whether the project has been setup according to this README. If `AppConfig` is missing, then displays the appropriate error message by redirecting the user to `AppLaunchFailureScene`.

## Roadmap

- [ ] **Search:** find your Floof faster 🏎️
- [ ] **Favorite images:** mark images you like the most ⭐️
- [ ] **Home Screen Widget:** display Floofs on your Springboard 📱
- [ ] **Dark mode support:** see better your Floofs in dim light situations, particularly at night 🌙
- [ ] **Error handling:** be informed when something goes wrong 5️⃣0️⃣0️⃣
- [ ] **Zoom view:** magnify the image 🔎 and share it
- [ ] **Increase test coverage:** never be surprised by 🐛🐛🐛
- [ ] **SwiftUI support:** see Floofs app written in the brand new, shiny UI framework ✨
- [ ] **Documentation:** read well documented interfaces 📕📗📘
- [ ] **Security:** improve security by changing a way how `AppConfig.plist` is stored 🔐
